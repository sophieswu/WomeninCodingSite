				<p>From 1972 to 1989, Elizabeth “Jake” Feinler ran the Network Information Center at the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California. Elizabeth J. Feinler was born and grew up in Wheeling, WV. She graduated from West Liberty University with a B.S. degree in chemistry in 1954. She then did graduate work in biochemistry at Purdue University under Dr. Roy Whistler. After working for several years in the chemistry industry, Ms. Feinler joined the Stanford Research Institute International (SRI) in Menlo Park, CA in 1960 as an information scientist.</p>

				<p>Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, and invented the <em>first compiler</em> for a computer programming language. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches (inspired by an actual moth removed from the computer). Owing to the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace". The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) is named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.</p>

				<p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world's first computer programmer.</p>

In the 1990s, she served as an executive for DreamWorks, Procter&amp; Gamble, and Hasbro. Whitman served as president and chief executive officer of eBay from 1998 to 2008. During her 10 years with the company, she oversaw its expansion from 30 employees and $4 million in annual revenue to more than 15,000 employees and $8 billion in annual revenue. In 2014, Whitman was named 20th in Forbes list of the 100 most powerful women in the world.</p>
