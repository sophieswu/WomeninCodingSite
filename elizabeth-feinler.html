				<h3> Early Life History </h3>
					<p> Elizabeth J. Feinler was born and grew up in Wheeling, WV. She graduated from West Liberty University with a B.S. degree in chemistry in 1954. She then did graduate work in biochemistry at Purdue University under Dr. Roy Whistler. After working for several years in the chemistry industry, Ms. Feinler joined the Stanford Research Institute International (SRI) in Menlo Park, CA in 1960 as an information scientist. <sup>[1]</sup> </p>

				<h3> Career at SRI International </h3>  
					<p> Shortly after joining the staff at SRI International, Feinler became a member of the Dr. Douglas Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center, where she began her work on the Internet. Her early networking effort was carried out on Host 2 of the Internet, where she pioneered and managed first the ARPNET, and then the Defense Data Network (DDN), network information centers (NIC) under contract to the Department of Defense (DoD). Both of these early networks were the forerunners of today’s Internet. </p>

					<p> She served as Principal Investigator for the NIC project from 1974, and Director for the Network Information Systems Center at SRI International from 1985-89, when she retired from SRI.  Her group developed the first Internet “yellow-” and “white-page” servers as well as the first query-based network host name and address (WHOIS) server. Her group managed the Host Naming Registry for the Internet from 1972 until 1989. As part of this effort she and her group developed the top-level domain naming scheme of .com, .edu, .gov, .mil, .org, and .net, which are still in use today on the Internet. <sup>[2]</sup> </p>

				<h3> Later Career </h3>  

					<p> After Feinler left SRI, in 1989, she worked as a network requirements manager and helped develop guidelines for managing the NASA Science Internet (NSI) NIC at the NASA Ames Research Center. At Ames she also was active in setting up the NASA Science Internet and Globe NICs, and assisted with guidelines for the development and management of the NASA World Wide Web. She retired in 1996. <sup>[4]</sup> </p>

				<h3> Recent Years </h3>
					<p>Since retiring, Feinler has been active as a volunteer for the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, where she donated, organized, and described over 350 boxes of archives from the Engelbart and NIC projets. <sup>[3]</sup> Feinler takes pride in her work to save for future generations the history of what has turned out to be one of the greatest inventions of the modern world - the Internet.</p>

				<h3> Quotes </h3>

				<p> <strong> With the IEEE Global History Network, Feinler on computers: </strong> <em> "Computers, frankly, I find very frustrating! They never do what I want them to do. Or they do it, but you have to talk to them in the right [language]; you have to learn their language. But I really found the sociology of the network was fascinating—and the technology. I think the Internet is one of the technological wonders of the world, and just to have been there at ground [zero]—we were the second host on the Internet, you know—was pretty exciting stuff! I was an observer, pretty much; I wasn’t in there pushing code, [though] as time went on I was developing information tools. But to observe it in the beginning was just fascinating: to see how everybody worked and interacted. It was very different. I came from chemistry, which is a very old discipline and had very structured ways of interacting. This was ground zero! Nobody had any ground rules."  </em> <sup> [5] </sup> </p>

				<p> <strong> With the IEEE Global History Network, Feinler on Computer Culture: </strong> <em> "Oh yes. First of all, it’s gotten a lot more structure. It’s gotten commercial. For me personally, I hate to see the Internet be so commercial. I mean, it’s just everybody out there trying to make a buck. And the worst thing, I think, is not that they’re trying to make money—that’s part of the game; but it really gets to me that you have to go down layer after layer after layer [of a web site] and then they say “Send money!” Oh! It makes me so angry. It’s like you’re trying to imply that this is a free service, but you go through these layers of junk—to my way of thinking—before you ever get to any substance. It’s even that way when you want to buy something. To me, it’s like telephones, where they have all these answering machines: “punch this,” “punch that,” “do this,” “do that!” You think, “I just want to get on with it!” That’s what makes me really frustrated with the Internet now. And the Tower of Babel: I think a lot of things could be consistent that are inconsistent. I mean, there’s no reason why you have to have twenty-five or thirty different email programs; they’re all doing pretty much the same thing. Maybe the programming could work better, or work differently, but the commands and the kinds of things you do could be much more uniform. But of course, nobody wants it; they want their thing to be slightly different, so they can say, “Mine’s different from theirs.” </em> <sup> [5] </sup> </p>

				<p> <strong> With the IEEE Global History Network, Feinler on advice for women in computing </strong> <em> "I think it’s a good field for women. It’s new, so there aren’t as many biases. You’re working with a fairly young crowd, so they don’t have all the old baggage of who should be in charge as much—even though there was a big old-boys’ network on the Internet, but I think that’s changing. I think there’s a lot of potential for women, and the jobs aren’t menial; the jobs are good ones. If you’ve got a good idea, I think you can run with it. It probably still takes about as much guts for women to get out there and put themselves on the front line as it ever did—but I don’t think they’ve got people saying, “You’ve got a gold mine if you’d only use it. What are you doing in the chemistry lab?”  It was really pretty bad in my day!" </em> <sup> [5] </sup>
