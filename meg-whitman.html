A native of Long Island, New York, she is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Business School. Whitman served as an executive in The Walt Disney Company where she was vice president of strategic planning throughout the 1980s. In the 1990s, she served as an executive for DreamWorks, Procter&amp; Gamble, and Hasbro. Whitman served as president and chief executive officer of eBay from 1998 to 2008. During her 10 years with the company, she oversaw its expansion from 30 employees and $4 million in annual revenue to more than 15,000 employees and $8 billion in annual revenue. In 2014, Whitman was named 20th in Forbes list of the 100 most powerful women in the world.</p>

			<h3>Working With Ebay</h3>
			<p>Whitman joined eBay on March 1998, when it had 30 employees and revenues of approximately $4 million. During her time as CEO, the company grew to approximately 15,000 employees and $8 billion in annual revenue by 2008. Originally, when Whitman had joined eBay, she found the website as a simple black and white webpage with courier font. On her first day, the site crashed for eight hours. She believed the site to be confusing and began by building a new executive team. Whitman organized the company by splitting it into twenty-three business categories. She then assigned executives to each, including some 35,000 subcategories. In 2004, Whitman made several key changes in her management team. Jeff Gordon took over PayPal, Matt Bannick took control of international operations and Bill Cobb was placed in control of U.S. operations,which has the colorful U.S. logo, while each international site has unique branding.</p>

			<p>Meg hand picked John J. Donahoe for eBay in March 2005 as President of eBay Marketplaces, responsible for all elements of eBay's global ecommerce businesses.</p>

			<p>During Whitman's tenure as CEO, eBay completed the purchase of Skype for $4.1B in cash and stock in September 2005. In 2009, Skype was sold by eBay at a valuation of $2.75B. In 2011, Skype was bought by Microsoft for US$8.5B.</p>

			<p>In June 2007, while preparing for an interview with Reuters, Whitman allegedly shoved her subordinate, communications employee Young Mi Kim. Of the incident, Whitman related, "In any high-pressure working environment, tensions can surface." Kim also stated, "Yes, we had an unfortunate incident, but we resolved it in a way that speaks well for her and for eBay." The matter was resolved after a $200,000 settlement.</p>

			<p>Whitman resigned as CEO of eBay in November 2007, but remained on the board and served as an advisor to new CEO John Donahoe until late 2008. She was inducted into the U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2008. "I've said for some time that 10 years is roughly the right time to stay at the helm at a company like ours", she said in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, addingthat "it's time for new leadership, a new perspective and a new vision."</p>

			<p>Whitman has received numerous awards and accolades for her work at eBay. On more than one occasion, she was named among the top five most powerful women by Fortune magazine. Harvard Business Review named her the eighth-best-performing CEO of the past decade and the Financial Times named her as one of the 50 faces that shaped the decade.</p>

			<h3>Working With Hewlett-Packard</h3>
			<p>In January 2011, Whitman joined Hewlett-Packard's board of directors. She took over as CEO in September 2011 after HP fired Léo Apotheker. It had lost $30 billion in market capitalization—more than a third of its value—during his tenure of less than a year. She reversed Apotheker's decision to sell the PC business and, as she had at eBay, reorganized HP's businesses in product clusters.</p>


			<h3>Political Career</h3>
			<p>On February 10, 2009, Whitman announced she would run for governor of California in the 2010 election. Her campaign was largely self-funded. She spent more of her own money on this effort than any other self-funded political candidate in U.S. history and ultimately lost to Jerry Brown. Whitman was a supporter of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2008 and was on his national finance team. She was also listed as finance co-chair of Romney's exploratory committee. After Romney stepped out of the race and endorsed McCain, Whitman joined McCain's presidential campaign as a national co-chair. McCain mentioned Whitman as a possible Secretary of the Treasury during the second presidential debate in 2008. However, McCain lost the 2008 general election to Barack Obama. While running for governor, Whitman emphasized three major areas: job creation, reduced state government spending, and reform of the state's K-12 educational system. She argued that it is best to start only a few things and finish them, instead of starting a lot of things and finishing few of them.</p>
